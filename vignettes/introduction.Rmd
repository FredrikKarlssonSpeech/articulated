## Overview

The **articulated** package provides tools for assessing speech articulation performance from acoustic data with emphasis on clinical and research applications.

### Key Features

- **High Performance**: Rcpp implementations provide 10-100x speedup
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: 30+ features covering rhythm and vowel space
- **superassp Integration**: Seamless workflow with superassp package
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel processing for large datasets
- **Clinical Focus**: Metrics validated in speech pathology research

## Quick Start

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(articulated)
library(superassp)

# Extract all features from audio file
features <- lst_articulation("speech.wav")

# View results
print(features$vsa)   # Vowel space area
print(features$npvi)  # Rhythm variability
```

See `vignette("superassp-integration")` for detailed workflows.
