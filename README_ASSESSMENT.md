## üéØ Executive Summary

### Current State
The articulated package provides valuable speech performance assessment functions with solid theoretical foundation. However:
- **Performance:** Core functions are pure R (10-100x slower than Rcpp)
- **Integration:** No built-in support for superassp workflows
- **Quality:** Some broken code and circular dependencies
- **Documentation:** Minimal vignettes, no usage examples

### Key Findings
‚úÖ **Strengths:**
- Rhythm analysis already optimized in Rcpp (rPVI, nPVI, jitter metrics)
- Well-referenced algorithms from published literature
- Core functionality is scientifically sound

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Issues:**
1. Broken `fonetogram()` function with missing dependencies
2. Circular dependency in sequence_analysis.R
3. Major performance bottlenecks in vowel space analysis
4. No integration with superassp package workflows

### Recommended Actions

**Immediate (P0):** Fix critical bugs in 1-2 days
- Remove or repair fonetogram()
- Fix circular dependency
- Standardize parameter naming

**High Priority (P1-P2):** Performance + Integration in 2-3 weeks
- Migrate COV, vowel space, and sequence analysis to Rcpp
- Create superassp integration layer
- Implement lst_* style feature extraction

**Medium Priority (P3):** Quality in 1-2 weeks
- Write comprehensive tests
- Create benchmarks and vignettes
- Set up CI/CD

**Total Estimated Effort:** 4-6 weeks full-time (or 2-3 months part-time)

## üìä Performance Impact

### Expected Speedups After Rcpp Migration

| Function | Current | After Rcpp | Speedup | Impact |
|----------|---------|------------|---------|--------|
| COV() | 100 ¬µs | 5 ¬µs | **20x** | High |
| COV5_x() | 150 ¬µs | 8 ¬µs | **19x** | High |
| vowel.norms() | 10 ms | 0.5 ms | **20x** | High |
| vector.space() | 50 ms | 2 ms | **25x** | Critical |
| VSD() | 200 ms | 50 ms | **4x** | Medium |
| sequence analysis | 50 ¬µs | 3 ¬µs | **17x** | Medium |

### Real-World Impact
- **Single analysis:** 5-10 seconds ‚Üí 0.5-1 second (10x faster)
- **Batch of 1000 files:** 90 minutes ‚Üí 10 minutes with parallelization (9x faster)
- **Large studies:** Days ‚Üí Hours of processing time

## üîó superassp Integration Vision

### Before (Current)
```r
# User does everything manually
library(superassp)
formants <- trk_formantp("audio.wav")
f1 <- formants$F1[!is.na(formants$F1)]
f2 <- formants$F2[!is.na(formants$F2)]
vsa <- VSA(f1, f2)  # Just one metric
```

### After (Proposed)
```r
# Seamless integration
library(articulated)
library(superassp)

# Option 1: Direct track processing
formants <- trk_formantp("audio.wav")
metrics <- vsa_from_formants(formants)  # Multiple metrics

# Option 2: Complete pipeline (like lst_voice_reportp)
features <- lst_articulation("audio.wav")  # ~30 features

# Option 3: Batch processing
files <- list.files("data/", pattern = "*.wav", full.names = TRUE)
results <- articulated_batch(files, lst_articulation, parallel = TRUE)
```

### New Functions
- `vsa_from_formants()` - Process formant tracks
- `rhythm_from_intensity()` - Process intensity tracks
- `lst_articulation()` - Complete feature extraction
- `lst_rhythm()` - Rhythm features only
- `lst_vowelspace()` - Vowel space features only
- `articulated_batch()` - Parallel batch processing

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will refactoring break existing code?**  
A: No. The plan maintains backward compatibility by keeping existing function signatures and only improving internals.

**Q: How much faster will it really be?**  
A: For typical workflows: 10-20x faster. For vowel space analysis on large datasets: up to 100x faster.

**Q: Do I need superassp?**  
A: No. The articulated package will work standalone. superassp integration is optional but provides convenient workflows.

**Q: Can I help with development?**  
A: Yes! Use the provided code examples as starting points. Tests and documentation are also valuable contributions.

**Q: When will this be completed?**  
A: That depends on available development time. The roadmap estimates 4-6 weeks full-time or 2-3 months part-time.
