#' Add additional information to the (eumRsegs) results of a query
#'
#' This function may be used to attach additional information to an \code{\link{emuRsegs}}
#' object. The additional information comes from a second \code{\link{emuRsegs}}
#' containing annotations that are ancestors of labels in the first \code{\link{emuRsegs}} object. That is, the ancestors should span the decendent labels in time. The labels
#' that add information could come for instance from a \code{\link{requery_hier}} call
#' but could also be the result of an entierly separate query.
#'
#' It is important to note that the information in the two \code{\link{emuRsegs}}
#' objects are merged by start and stop time, and not by hierarchy.
#'
#'
#' @param dbHandle An emuR databse handle.
#' @param segs The original \code{\link{emuRsegs}} object.
#' @param parentSegs The \code{\link{emuRsegs}} object containg the additional information that should be added to the \code{segs} argument object.
#' @param resultType Can only be "tibble" at the moment, and the function will therefore return a \code{\link{ti}}.
#' @param add.metadata Boolean: Should metadata associated with the bundle from which \code{segs} was returned be attached to the output "tibble" as columns? #TODO
#'
#' @return A "tibble" that has the columns of the \code{segs}, but with the columns of
#' \code{parentSegs} appended to the right, where a parent is match by its decendant by
#' the part of the time line of the signal that they share. A prefix "parent_" is added
#' to all the columns in \code{parentSegs}. That is, a label A will be on the same row
#' as the parent P if, for instance, sample_start > parent_sample_start and
#' sample_end < parent_sampe_end in the output.
